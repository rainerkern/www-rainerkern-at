Feature Branch Deployments of your App to Amazon-ec2
===================
_published on the 1st of October 2019_

In this guide I want to show you the steps necessary to automatically provision ec2 instances from your CI environment.
This will allow you to continuously deploy your application. These scripts can also be used to setup a powerful _per-branch-deployment_
which will give you a separate test environment for every feature branch of your project - thus allowing you to test
and review changes earlier and individually. 

Amazon Web Services already offer a very powerful CLI which can be used from within any python capable CI environment and
provides almost all actions which are available via the GUI. We are going to use these capabilities to perform the following steps:

1. provision a new ec2 instance
2. set the instance name to a desired value
3. retrieve the instances public dns 
4. (optionally) decommission our instance 


This guide assumes that you have the [aws-shell](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
installed and configured. The key-pair used in this script is named `development_deployment`.

### Create a new Security Group
Go to the [aws web console](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-central-1#SecurityGroups:sort=groupId)
and setup a new security group called "application_servers". You have to `allow inbound traffic` on some ports
to be able to access your instance remotely
* SSH
* HTTP, HTTPS
* port 8080 (if you are using tomcat)
* port 3000 (if you are using node) 

### Create an SSH Keypair

### Scripts
Admit it â€¦ this is what you are really here for ;-)


```
#!/bin/sh
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-central-1"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export EC2_INSTANCE_NAME="develop-my-new-feature"       # environment name
export EC2_IMAGE_AMI="ami-03c87d96f6702a119"            # the ami image which serves as our base
export EC2_MACHINE_SIZE="t2.micro"
export EC2_SECURITY_GRP="application_servers"


# 1. Provision a new instance for the feature branch
# The file bin/ec2-startup.sh will be copied to the instance and executed upon startup
INSTANCE_ID=$(aws ec2 run-instances --count 1 \
  --region ${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}              \
  --image-id ${EC2_IMAGE_AMI}                 \
  --instance-type ${EC2_MACHINE_SIZE}         \
  --security-groups ${EC2_SECURITY_GRP}       \
  --key-name development_deployment           \
  --user-data file://bin/ec2-startup.sh       \
 | jq -r ".Instances[].InstanceId")


# 2. Set the name of the instance (decomissioning will rely on that)
aws ec2 create-tags                             \
  --tags "Key=Name,Value=${EC2_INSTANCE_NAME}"  \
  --resources "$INSTANCE_ID"


# 3. Save our public dns name, so we can access our instance later
PUBLIC_DNS=$(aws ec2 describe-instances                \
  --filters "Name=instance-id,Values=$INSTANCE_ID"     \
 | jq -r ".Reservations[].Instances[].NetworkInterfaces[].Association.PublicDnsName")


# 4. Decmission instances after we are done
# This command can also be run as the first command, to decomission instances  
# which were created previously
aws ec2 describe-instances                              \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=$EC2_INSTANCE_NAME"   \
  | jq -r ".Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId"      \
  | xargs --no-run-if-empty aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-id

```




**bin/ec2-startup.sh**

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y

# This swill start a simple apache2 http server on port 80
sudo chkconfig httpd on
sudo mkdir /var/log/httpd
sudo service httpd start
```
