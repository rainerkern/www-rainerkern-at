# Preparation and Introduction

Welcome to our first class of this course start programming using Kotlin. We'll introduce you to Kotlin concepts, help you set up your development environment, and create your first Hello World program.
We recommend doing this lesson by reading the topics, watching the video series and finally practising the exercises.
Feel free to ask any questions via email.
Cheers and happy coding,
Rainer



## What is Kotlin, Java, JVM?

Kotlin is a relatively young programming language. For execution, Kotlin needs a runtime library called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kotlin is fully interoperable in both directions with the much older Java programming language (Java also needs the JVM to run). This means that Kotlin can make use of all the very mature and useful libraries and tools of the Java ecosystem. Also, Java applications can use classes and libraries developed in Kotlin.So to fully use Kotlin you must also learn at least a little bit about the Java ecosystem.



## Set up the development environment

The Java ecosystem can be a confusing place to new developers which is why in the beginning we focus only on the Java Development Kit (JDK) which you need to develop Kotlin. The JDK includes the JVM which you need to run Kotlin. The JVM does not include the JDK.

Historically, there are different editions of Java (JRE and JDK)
Standard Edition (Java SE) , Enterprise Edition (Java EE) , Micro Edition (Java ME) JavaFX...

Every edition provides special functionality for different use cases. For now, you only need the development Kit for the Java Standard Edition (Java SE JDK). You can download either the Oracle JDK: [java.com](https://www.java.com) or from the Open JDK: [openjdk.java.net](https://openjdk.java.net). Make sure that you really download the JDK, not the JRE.

Software development in Kotlin is preferably done in IntelliJ by JetBrains. As of the time of this writing, IntelliJ has the best support for the Kotlin language. There are pro and free versions available so there is no financial barrier to using this software.



## Running Your First Hello World Program

If your machine is already set up, you can watch video 1 and 4 below to create your Hello World program. However, if you have any questions in the previous topics or you would like to reinforce them, we recommend watching the videos from 1 to 4.



## Watch video series
